What I learn from today ?

Summery

1- sealed classes can not have child class.

2- sealed method can not be overriden.

3- base is reference which refer to Base class's object.If Base class and 
              Derived class have members with same name then base should be 
              used to access base class's specific members.

4- static members are accessed using class names

5- Command line arguments are used by CLR to form string array, 
           which is passed as a argument to main(string[] args);

6- In one class, having multiple methods with same name but different arguments is method overloading
